### Hi! - Chi Po Choi
Hello everyone! My name is Po. I did bachelor+master in mathematics a while ago in Hong Kong, with some exposure in geometry (with applications in medical imagining, if have to make it related to bio-ish...) before shifting gears to do statistics here in Davis, working on something related to the Big Bang. I am also trying to get into data science things in Bay area. Super excited to meet you all in person here!

# R, RStudio and RMarkdown

### Install R and RStudio

1. Go to https://cloud.r-project.org/ and download+install *R* by following instructions corresponding to your operation system (MacOS, Windows or Linux).

2. Go to https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/ and download+install **RStudio Desktop** corresponding to your operation system (MacOS, Windows or Linux).

3. In case the above not working, here are some other/advanced ways to have RStudio ready in your hands: [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud), [Rstudio Server Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/rstudio), or maybe [RStudio in Binder](https://mybinder.org/) [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ucdavis-sta-100-spring-2021/polabs/main?urlpath=rstudio)

### RMarkdown 

1. â†– Click **New File** then new **R Markdown**. Click Yes to the pop-up to install all necessary R packages. And proceed to create your first R Markdown file.

   In cases somethings goes wrong, try following [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide -> Installation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/installation.html) to manually install R packages `rmarkdown` and `tinytex`. 

2. Save and Knit into html and pdf. ![Knit](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/RStudio_knit_icon.png){width=10%}

3. Get the `template.Rmd` in [Files/templates at STA100 Canvas site ](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/556874/files/folder/templates) . Try to load it into RStudio and Knit into pdf.

4. For more info, visit https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/ .


#### R tutorial

- Interactive R course lessons **swirl** https://swirlstats.com/students.html

  Install **swirl** with the following commands.
  ```{r eval=FALSE}
  # If you haven't installed the swirl package yet
  install.packages("swirl")
  library(swirl)
  install_course_github("swirldev", "R_Programming_E")
  ```

  After **swirl** is installed (you only need to do it once), you can start/resume the R tutorial with the commands:
  ```{r eval=FALSE}
  library(swirl)
  swirl()
  ```
  Schedule some time to go though all the lessons by yourself! Almost all of the R codes you need to know are here in those lessons.
